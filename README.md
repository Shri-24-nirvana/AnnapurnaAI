# Annapurna-AI
Annapurna AI is an intelligent B2B SaaS platform designed to eliminate food waste in institutional kitchens—such as college canteens, corporate cafeterias, and hospitals—by replacing traditional guesswork with data-driven, prescriptive intelligence.

The Problem 
In India, institutional foodservice is a major contributor to the nation's food waste crisis, which accounts for an economic loss of over ₹900 billion annually. This inefficiency stems from outdated, manual processes, primarily inaccurate demand forecasting, which leads to systemic overproduction and significant financial and environmental costs.

Our Solution
Annapurna AI tackles this problem with a holistic, cloud-based platform that optimizes the entire food lifecycle, from procurement to consumption. The system consists of two interconnected components:
A User-Facing Mobile App: Allows end-users (students, employees) to effortlessly mark meals they plan to skip and provide real-time feedback on food quality.
An Admin Dashboard: Provides kitchen managers with a live headcount and, most importantly, a precise, AI-generated forecast of the exact quantity of each food item to prepare.
Our core innovation is prescriptive intelligence. We don't just report on past waste; our AI engine proactively prevents it before it occurs.

Technology & Features
The platform is built on a modern cloud architecture and leverages a sophisticated AI engine to deliver its core value.
AI & Machine Learning: We employ an ensemble of advanced machine learning models, including LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA), to capture complex, non-linear demand patterns and predictable seasonal cycles with high accuracy.

AI-Powered Demand Forecasting: The predictive heart of the platform, providing actionable instructions to kitchen staff.
Smart Inventory Management: Automates stock level tracking and generates intelligent replenishment recommendations to prevent spoilage.
Waste Analytics & Tracking: Uses integrated hardware to capture and categorize food waste, creating a continuous feedback loop that makes our AI models smarter over time.
Procurement Optimization: Streamlines the purchasing process by generating optimized orders based on predicted demand.
